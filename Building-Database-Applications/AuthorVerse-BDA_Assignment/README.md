# AuthorVerse - Staff Graded Assignment 2

Question 1 - 
Your task is to build a Spring Boot application to manage information for any two entities of your choice (e.g., Books and Authors, Students and Courses). You are required to implement three operations: creating, reading, and updating data for these entities.

**Operations:**

**Populate Database:**

- Once the entities are identified, create the required tables in the database using JPA and populate all the tables with sample data (10 rows in each table).

**Create Operation:**

- Implement a form in a JSP page to add entities.

- Create a controller method to handle the form submission and save the new entities.

- Handle exceptions in case of any integrity violations.

**Read Operation:**

- Implement a view in JSP that displays a list of all entities.

- Create a controller method that fetches data from the service layer and binds it to the JSP view.

- Implement a custom query method in the repository layer that performs an inner join between both entities and returns the result.

**Update Operation:**

- Implement functionality to update the details of existing entities.

- Create a controller method to handle the update request and save the updated data to the database.

**Requirements:**

**Entity Classes:**

- Define the entities, their attributes, and relationships using JPA annotations like @Entity, @Id, @OneToMany, etc., to define relationships and other constraints.

**Repository Layer:**

- Create repository interfaces for the entities, extending JpaRepository.

- Include custom query methods as mentioned.

**Service Layer:**

- Implement service classes to handle business logic.

- Ensure proper integration with the repository layer.

**Controller Layer:**

- Implement Spring MVC controllers for handling HTTP requests related to the entities.

- Ensure proper data binding between the model and the view using JSTL or Expression Language (EL).

**View Layer:**

- Create JSP pages to display the form for adding entities, listing entities, and updating existing entity details.

- Apply CSS styles to make the JSP pages visually appealing.

**Testing:**

- Write unit tests for your repository and service methods using frameworks like JUnit and Mockito.

- Test the application by performing create, read, and update operations via the web interface.

**Submission Requirements:**

- A PDF document explaining your approach, including:

* Entity relationship design,

* Implementation details for each operation (Code and screenshots),

* Challenges faced and how you overcame them,

Github URL of the project.
